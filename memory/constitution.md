# Academic Writing Constitution

**Purpose**: This document establishes the foundational principles and standards for all academic work produced using this template. These principles ensure academic integrity, quality, and ethical scholarship.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Academic Integrity

**All work must be original and honest.**

- ✅ **DO**: Write in your own words, synthesize ideas, cite all sources
- ✅ **DO**: Distinguish between your ideas and others' ideas
- ✅ **DO**: Use quotation marks for any verbatim text + cite
- ❌ **DON'T**: Copy-paste from sources without quotation marks and citation
- ❌ **DON'T**: Paraphrase too closely (change words but keep structure)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use AI-generated text as your own without disclosure (if required by institution)

**Plagiarism is never acceptable**, even unintentional. When in doubt, cite.

### 2. Proper Attribution

**Every intellectual debt must be acknowledged.**

- ✅ **DO**: Cite when using others' ideas, data, arguments, or findings
- ✅ **DO**: Cite when building on previous research
- ✅ **DO**: Use signal phrases ("According to Smith...", "Research shows...")
- ✅ **DO**: Cite visual materials (figures, tables, images) if not original
- ❌ **DON'T**: Present others' work as your own
- ❌ **DON'T**: Assume something is "common knowledge" unless certain
- ❌ **DON'T**: Forget to cite paraphrased content

**Citation is strength**, not weakness. It shows you've engaged with scholarship.

### 3. Original Analysis

**Your unique contribution must be evident.**

- ✅ **DO**: Provide your own analysis and interpretation
- ✅ **DO**: Synthesize sources to create new understanding
- ✅ **DO**: Ask critical questions and evaluate evidence
- ✅ **DO**: Connect ideas in novel ways
- ❌ **DON'T**: Simply summarize or compile sources
- ❌ **DON'T**: Let sources speak for themselves without your analysis
- ❌ **DON'T**: Hide behind quotations without interpretation

**You are the author**. Sources support your argument; they don't replace it.

### 4. Intellectual Honesty

**Represent all perspectives fairly and acknowledge limitations.**

- ✅ **DO**: Present opposing views accurately
- ✅ **DO**: Acknowledge limitations of your argument or research
- ✅ **DO**: Distinguish between facts, interpretations, and opinions
- ✅ **DO**: Report findings honestly, even if they contradict your hypothesis
- ❌ **DON'T**: Cherry-pick evidence to support only your view
- ❌ **DON'T**: Misrepresent others' arguments to make them easier to refute
- ❌ **DON'T**: Ignore contradictory evidence

**Academic work seeks truth**, not just confirmation.

## Quality Standards

### 5. Research Excellence

**Use credible, appropriate, and sufficient sources.**

- ✅ **DO**: Prioritize peer-reviewed academic sources
- ✅ **DO**: Use current sources (especially in fast-moving fields)
- ✅ **DO**: Evaluate source quality (authority, accuracy, bias)
- ✅ **DO**: Use diverse source types (books, journals, reports)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Rely heavily on non-academic sources (Wikipedia, blogs)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use outdated sources when newer research exists
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use too few sources (insufficient research)

**Quality over quantity**, but sufficient depth is required.

### 6. Clear Communication

**Write to be understood, not to impress.**

- ✅ **DO**: Use clear, direct language
- ✅ **DO**: Define technical terms when first used
- ✅ **DO**: Organize logically with clear transitions
- ✅ **DO**: Use active voice when appropriate
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use jargon unnecessarily
- ❌ **DON'T**: Write overly complex sentences to sound "academic"
- ❌ **DON'T**: Assume readers have your background knowledge

**Clarity is a virtue** in academic writing.

### 7. Logical Argumentation

**Every claim must be supported; every argument must be coherent.**

- ✅ **DO**: State thesis clearly and early
- ✅ **DO**: Support major claims with evidence
- ✅ **DO**: Ensure premises lead logically to conclusions
- ✅ **DO**: Address counterarguments when relevant
- ❌ **DON'T**: Make unsupported assertions
- ❌ **DON'T**: Use logical fallacies (ad hominem, false dichotomy, etc.)
- ❌ **DON'T**: Leave gaps in reasoning

**Logic is non-negotiable** in academic work.

### 8. Format Excellence

**Presentation matters; follow discipline conventions.**

- ✅ **DO**: Follow assignment specifications exactly
- ✅ **DO**: Use consistent citation style throughout
- ✅ **DO**: Format bibliography correctly
- ✅ **DO**: Proofread for grammar, spelling, typos
- ❌ **DON'T**: Ignore formatting requirements
- ❌ **DON'T**: Mix citation styles
- ❌ **DON'T**: Submit without careful proofreading

**Professional presentation** shows respect for your work and reader.

## Workflow Standards

### 9. Version Control & Documentation

**Track your process; preserve your work.**

- ✅ **DO**: Version all generated files (v01, v02, v03...)
- ✅ **DO**: Keep backups of important work
- ✅ **DO**: Document research process and decisions
- ✅ **DO**: Save drafts at major milestones
- ❌ **DON'T**: Overwrite earlier versions
- ❌ **DON'T**: Rely on single copy without backup
- ❌ **DON'T**: Delete brainstorming or planning documents

**Your process is valuable**. Document it.

### 10. Time Management & Planning

**Quality work requires adequate time.**

- ✅ **DO**: Start early; allow time for research and revision
- ✅ **DO**: Follow the phase-based workflow
- ✅ **DO**: Build in buffer time for unexpected issues
- ✅ **DO**: Prioritize high-impact tasks
- ❌ **DON'T**: Rush research or writing phases
- ❌ **DON'T**: Skip the outline or planning stage
- ❌ **DON'T**: Submit first draft without revision

**Good work takes time**. Plan accordingly.
