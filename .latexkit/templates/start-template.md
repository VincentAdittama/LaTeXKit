# Project Start File: [DOCUMENT_TITLE]

**Document ID**: `[AUTO-GENERATED]`  
**Created**: `[YYYY-MM-DD]`  
**Status**: `[Draft/Review/Approved]`

## Executive Summary

### Purpose
<!-- What is this document for? Why does it need to exist? -->

[Brief description of the document's purpose and goals]

### Type
**Document Type**: `[Assignment/Research Paper/Proposal/Report/Thesis Chapter/Other]`

### Document Output Language
**Final Document Language**: `Indonesian` (default)

<!-- ⚠️ IMPORTANT: This setting controls the language of your FINAL COMPILED PDF -->
<!-- The LaTeX conversion step will transform ALL content to match this language -->
<!-- Research, outline, and draft phases can use ANY language — conversion handles translation -->

**Language Options**:
- `Indonesian` — All LaTeX output in Indonesian (Pendahuluan, Metodologi, Kesimpulan, etc.)
- `English` — All LaTeX output in English (Introduction, Methodology, Conclusion, etc.)
- `Bilingual` — Mixed language sections (specify per-section if needed)

**How It Works**:
1. **Planning Phase** (research/outline/draft): Use any language that's comfortable
2. **Conversion Phase**: `/latexkit.convert` reads this setting and transforms content
3. **Final PDF**: Compiled document matches the language specified here

**Example Transformation** (if set to Indonesian):
- Draft: "## Introduction" → LaTeX: `\section{Pendahuluan}`
- Draft: "The research shows..." → LaTeX: "Penelitian ini menunjukkan..."
- Draft: "## Methodology" → LaTeX: `\section{Metodologi}`

### Key Requirements
<!-- Top 3-5 critical requirements that define success -->

1. [Requirement 1]
2. [Requirement 2]
